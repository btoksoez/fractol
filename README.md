# Fractol 

Welcome to my Fractal project repository! This project is part of the 42 curriculum and involves creating a basic computer graphics application to explore the fascinating world of fractals using the MiniLibX library. You will be able to visualize the Julia set, the Mandelbrot set and the Mandelbox set, zoom into them using your mouse, change the resolution and experiment with different parameters to see the beautiful complexity of these mathematical objects.

## Introduction

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, whose pattern remains the same at every scale. The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974, based on the Latin word "fractus," meaning "broken" or "fractured." Various natural phenomena, such as the romanesco cabbage, exhibit fractal features.

This project leverages the MiniLibX graphical library to render and explore fractals. The MiniLibX library includes the basic tools necessary to open a window, create images, and handle keyboard and mouse events.

## Features

- **Fractal Sets:** Render both the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
- **Zooming:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, exploring the fractals almost infinitely.
- **Dynamic Julia Sets:** Create different Julia sets by passing various parameters to the program.
- **Rendering Options:** Define fractal types and rendering options through command line parameters.
- **Color Depth:** Use multiple colors to illustrate the depth of each fractal, with potential for psychedelic effects.
